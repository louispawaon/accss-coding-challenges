'''
Create a function to find only the root value of x in any quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c. The function will take three arguments:
a as the coefficient of x^2
b as the coefficient of x
c as the constant term
For example:

quadraticEquation(1, 2, -3) ➞ 1

quadraticEquation(2, -7, 3) ➞ 3

quadraticEquation(1, -12, -28) ➞ 14
